        I am an Web & iOS Developer who just started my journey in tech. I am a
        career changer driven by curiosity and believe software development
        maximises my potential like no other field. I am very eager to apply my
        skills and master new ones in both a supportive and challenging
        environment that makes me grow professionally and personally.
